# Overview
This website controls and modifies events held by Clemson University, featuring both an admin and user interface. Admins have special privileges to create and modify events, while users can view upcoming events and "purchase" tickets. This group project, part of my software engineering course, aimed to develop our full-stack skills. We followed Scrum methodology, with each team member assigned specific roles, using Trello to track progress and manage tasks. Weekly sprints were conducted to complete assigned tasks, but the project was cut short due to professor cancellations.
